# Quick and Simple Boolean Evaluator

Todo @me: add documentation. Currently there is a brief documentation in the comments at the top of booleanEvaluator.py

The main thing is just how to run.
To run do: `python3 booleanEvaluator.py -e "<your expression>"`

## IMPORTANT:
The NOT operation doesn't work yet. It's a weird syntactical form. Sorry :(
